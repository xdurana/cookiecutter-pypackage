# Developing inside a Container in VSCode

The Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set. A [devcontainer.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_create-a-devcontainerjson-file) file in your project tells VS Code how to access (or create) a development container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an application or to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase.

If you open the project in VSCode, you can reopen the folder in the development container and have a full working environment.
